<h2>My top 3 favorite movies of all time.</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Made in Abyss: Dawn of the Deep Soul</h3>
<p>If you watched season 1 of Made in Abyss, this is the continuation of that and it takes place before season 2 so it's definitely a must watch. I cried a lot.</p>

<h3>Coco</h3>
<p>I wish mexican people were real.</p>

<h3>Heneral Luna</h3>
<p>Perfection, would watch again.</p>
